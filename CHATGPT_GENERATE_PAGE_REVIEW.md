# Generate Page Components - ChatGPT Review

## Overview
This PR contains all the generate page related components and files for ChatGPT to review. The goal is to get a proper refactoring plan that splits the large GeneratePage.tsx into smaller, maintainable components while preserving the exact same UI and functionality.

## Current Structure

### Main Files
- `src/components/pages/GeneratePage.tsx` - The original large file (reverted to working version)
- `src/components/generate/Orchestrator.tsx` - Simple coordinator component
- `src/components/generate/SingleSheetFlow.tsx` - Contains step implementations
- `src/components/generate/multi/MultiSheetFlow.tsx` - Multi-sheet workflow
- `src/components/generate/multi/Step1MultiSheet.tsx` - Step 1 implementation
- `src/components/generate/multi/Step2MultiSheet.tsx` - Step 2 implementation
- `src/components/generate/multi/Step3MultiSheet.tsx` - Step 3 implementation

### Supporting Files
- `src/store/generateStore.ts` - Zustand store for state management
- `src/types/sheets.ts` - Type definitions for sheets
- `src/lib/grouping/` - Grouping utilities
- `src/lib/export/` - Export utilities
- `src/lib/render/` - Rendering utilities

## What ChatGPT Needs to See

1. **The actual GeneratePage.tsx code** - This is the large file that needs to be split
2. **Current component structure** - How we've started organizing things
3. **The working UI and functionality** - What needs to be preserved exactly

## Goal
Create a refactoring plan that:
- ✅ Keeps the exact same UI and user experience
- ✅ Splits the large GeneratePage.tsx into smaller components
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality
- ✅ Makes the code more maintainable
- ❌ Does NOT change the user interface or workflow

## Files to Review
Please focus on these key files:
- `src/components/pages/GeneratePage.tsx` (the main file to split)
- `src/components/generate/SingleSheetFlow.tsx` (current attempt)
- `src/components/generate/multi/` (multi-sheet components)

## Current Status
- App is working with original GeneratePage.tsx
- Some modular components exist but aren't integrated
- Need a solid plan to properly split without breaking anything
