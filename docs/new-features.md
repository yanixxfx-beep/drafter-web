# New Features Added

## 1. AI Method Image Fallback (October 12, 2025)

### Feature
If no AI Method images are uploaded for last slides, the system will automatically fall back to using Affiliate images instead.

### Why This Matters
- **Prevents generation failures**: Users can still generate content even if they haven't uploaded AI Method images yet
- **Smooth workflow**: The system continues working regardless of which image categories are available
- **Clear feedback**: Console logs show when the fallback is being used

### How It Works
```
Last Slide Logic:
1. Check if AI Method images are available
2. If YES → Use AI Method images (normal behavior)
3. If NO → Use Affiliate images as fallback
4. Log warning: "⚠️ No AI Method images available! Using Affiliate images as fallback for last slide."
```

### Console Output
When fallback occurs, you'll see:
```
⚠️ No AI Method images available! Using Affiliate images as fallback for last slide.
Idea 1, Slide 3: Using Affiliate image (fallback for last slide)
```

## 2. Support for Up to 13 Slides Per Idea (October 12, 2025)

### Feature
The system now supports generating up to **13 slides per idea** (previously limited to 6).

### Why This Matters
- **More flexibility**: Create longer content pieces for detailed topics
- **Better storytelling**: More slides means more room to develop ideas
- **Matches user needs**: Some content strategies benefit from longer formats

### How It Works
- **Automatic detection**: The system automatically detects slide columns from your Google Sheet
- **Pattern matching**: Recognizes columns like "Slide 1", "Slide 2", ... "Slide 13" (or "slide1", "Caption 1", etc.)
- **Dynamic UI**: The interface adapts to display any number of slides
- **No configuration needed**: Just add more "Slide X" columns to your spreadsheet

### Supported Column Patterns
The system recognizes these patterns (case-insensitive):
- `Slide 1`, `Slide 2`, ... `Slide 13`
- `slide1`, `slide2`, ... `slide13`
- `Caption 1`, `Caption 2`, ... `Caption 13`
- `Slide_1`, `Slide-1`, etc.

### Technical Details
- **Regex pattern**: `/(slide|caption)[ _\-]*([0-9]{1,2})/`
- **Supports**: 1-99 slides theoretically (tested up to 13)
- **Sorting**: Automatically sorts by number, regardless of column order

### Console Output
When generating, you'll see:
```
Slide columns: ["Slide 1", "Slide 2", "Slide 3", ... "Slide 13"]
Total ideas: 10
Max slides per idea: 13 (supports up to 13 slides)
```

## Implementation Notes

### Files Modified
- `drafter-web/src/components/pages/GeneratePage.tsx`
  - Added AI Method fallback logic (lines 1640-1646)
  - Added console log for max slides support (line 1588)

### No Breaking Changes
- Both features are **backward compatible**
- Existing 6-slide projects continue to work normally
- No changes required to existing spreadsheets

### Performance Considerations
- **13 slides**: Generation time scales linearly with slide count
- **Batch export**: Continues to work efficiently for larger idea sets
- **Memory usage**: Minimal impact; canvas objects are properly cleaned up

## Testing

### To Test AI Method Fallback
1. Create a new project
2. Upload only Affiliate images (skip AI Method images)
3. Generate content
4. Check console for fallback warning messages
5. Verify last slides use Affiliate images

### To Test 13 Slides Support
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Add columns: `Slide 7`, `Slide 8`, ... `Slide 13`
3. Fill in captions for these slides
4. Refresh Drafter and load the spreadsheet
5. Generate content
6. Verify all 13 slides are generated and displayed

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- [ ] Add UI indicator when using fallback images
- [ ] Allow users to set custom max slides (beyond 13)
- [ ] Add analytics to track average slides per idea
- [ ] Optimize batch export for very large slide counts (10+)

### Known Limitations
- UI displays slides in 2-column grid (may need scrolling for 13 slides)
- Export time increases with more slides per idea
- Mobile view may be less optimal with many slides
