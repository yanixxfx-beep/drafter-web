# Image Scaling & Text Positioning Fix

## üéØ **Issues Fixed**

1. **Images were cropped too aggressively** - `drawCover` was cutting off too much of the image
2. **Text was positioned too low** - text was getting cut off at the bottom of slides

## üîß **Solution 1: Better Image Scaling**

### **Problem**
The `drawCover` function uses `Math.max(W/iw, H/ih)` which implements "object-fit: cover" - it scales the image to fill the entire canvas, cropping parts that don't fit.

### **Solution**
Created a new `drawContain` function that uses `Math.min(W/iw, H/ih)` which implements "object-fit: contain" - it scales the image to fit entirely within the canvas, showing more of the image.

### **Changes Made**

**1. Added `drawContain` function to `drafter-web/src/utils/image.ts`:**
```typescript
export function drawContain(ctx: CanvasRenderingContext2D, img: ImageBitmap | HTMLImageElement, W: number, H: number) {
  const iw = (img as any).width, ih = (img as any).height;
  const s = Math.min(W/iw, H/ih);  // Changed from Math.max to Math.min
  const dw = iw*s, dh = ih*s;
  ctx.drawImage(img as any, (W-dw)/2, (H-dh)/2, dw, dh);
}
```

**2. Updated imports in both files:**
```typescript
import { drawCover, drawContain, loadWithOrientation } from '@/utils/image'
```

**3. Replaced all `drawCover` calls with `drawContain`:**
- `GeneratePage.tsx` - `randomizeAllImages()` function
- `GeneratePage.tsx` - `randomizeSingleSlideImage()` function  
- `GeneratePage.tsx` - `handleSaveSlide()` function
- `SlideEditor.tsx` - `renderPreview()` function

## üîß **Solution 2: Better Text Positioning**

### **Problem**
With `drawContain`, more of the image is now visible, but the text was still positioned based on the original layout calculations, making it appear too low relative to the visible image content.

### **Solution**
Adjusted the default `yOffset` from `0` to `-100` pixels to move text up by default.

### **Changes Made**

**1. Updated default yOffset in `GeneratePage.tsx`:**
```typescript
// Line 601 - Changed from 0 to -100
yOffset: -100,
```

**2. Updated fallback yOffsetPx values:**
```typescript
// Changed from 0 to -100 in multiple locations
yOffsetPx: step2Data?.yOffset !== undefined ? step2Data.yOffset : -100,
```

**3. Updated SlideEditor default handling:**
```typescript
// Better fallback chain for yOffset
const [yOffset, setYOffset] = useState(
  slide.styleOverride?.yOffset !== undefined 
    ? slide.styleOverride.yOffset 
    : (globalSettings.yOffset !== undefined ? globalSettings.yOffset : -100)
)
```

## üìä **Comparison: drawCover vs drawContain**

### **drawCover (object-fit: cover)**
```typescript
const s = Math.max(W/iw, H/ih);  // Scale to fill entire canvas
```
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: No empty space, fills entire canvas
- ‚ùå **Cons**: Crops parts of the image, can lose important content

### **drawContain (object-fit: contain)**
```typescript
const s = Math.min(W/iw, H/ih);  // Scale to fit entirely within canvas
```
- ‚úÖ **Pros**: Shows entire image, no content lost
- ‚ùå **Cons**: May leave some empty space (filled with background color)

## üéØ **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix:**
- ‚ùå Images were heavily cropped (only showing small portion)
- ‚ùå Text was positioned too low, getting cut off
- ‚ùå Important image content was lost

### **After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Images show more content (less cropped)
- ‚úÖ Text is positioned higher, fully visible
- ‚úÖ Better balance between image visibility and text placement

## üß™ **Testing Instructions**

1. **Hard refresh** the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Generate some drafts
3. **Expected**: Images should show more content, less cropping
4. **Expected**: Text should be positioned higher, not cut off at bottom
5. Click **üé≤ Randomize All Images**
6. **Expected**: All slides should show more of their images
7. Click **Edit** on any slide
8. **Expected**: SlideEditor should show more of the image with properly positioned text
9. **Export** any slide
10. **Expected**: PNG should contain the full image with well-positioned text

## üìù **Files Modified**

### **Created/Modified:**
- `drafter-web/src/utils/image.ts` - Added `drawContain` function
- `drafter-web/src/components/pages/GeneratePage.tsx` - Updated imports and function calls, changed default yOffset
- `drafter-web/src/components/pages/SlideEditor.tsx` - Updated imports and function calls, improved yOffset fallback

### **Key Changes:**
- **4 locations** changed from `drawCover` to `drawContain`
- **Default yOffset** changed from `0` to `-100`
- **Multiple fallback values** updated for consistent positioning

## üé® **Visual Impact**

- **More image content visible** - Users can see more of their uploaded images
- **Better text positioning** - Text is properly centered and visible
- **Improved user experience** - Less frustration with cropped images and cut-off text
- **Maintained quality** - Still high-resolution rendering, just better composition

---

**Both issues should now be resolved!** Images will show more content and text will be properly positioned. üéâ
